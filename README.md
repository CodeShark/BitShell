BitShell
========

A wrapper around bitcoind's CLI for use with ConsoleShell.

You must set the path to the ConsoleShell root directory in a file named paths.mk in the project root for the project to build.
You can find the ConsoleShell project here: https://github.com/CodeShark/ConsoleShell

To edit the commands, edit utils/commands.py and then run the utils/generatesource script.
